# RetroVerse

## Description
RetroVerse is a nostalgia-first media discovery and workbench platform built on top of VirtualDJ exports. It combines fast private search tools with playful public discovery experiences, all powered by a single source of truth: VDJ tags, MP4 metadata, and chart data.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Media collections become overwhelming
Most systems either give you a giant list or force rigid organization. RetroVerse solves this with fast filtering, grouping, and playlist tools optimized for DJs with large video libraries.

### Problem 2: Nostalgia is hard to explore intentionally
People remember songs, shows, eras, moods — not file paths. RetroVerse's discovery mode turns personal memory into a navigable interface through Time Travel, Era Lenses, and Chart Journeys.

### Problem 3: Metadata is inconsistent across decades
RetroVerse enforces a unified data model, cleaning and normalizing VirtualDJ exports so they feed both the workbench and the discovery universe.
