### 1. Workbench Core (Video Library v1)
Fast private search, filtering, decade navigation, and playlist building using VirtualDJ's VideoFiles.json as the data source.

### 2. Data Pipeline & Source-of-Truth
Standardized JSON/CSV ingestion, MP4 metadata alignment, chart data integration, and fuzzy-matching utilities to handle imperfect tags.

### 3. Discovery Mode v1 (Time Travel, Era Lens)
Playful, nostalgia-driven experiences that surface personal meaning without requiring perfect metadata.

### 4. Discovery Mode v2 (Chart Journey)
Deep chart navigation, related-song exploration, and cross-era comparison powered by Billboard Hot 100 history.

### 5. RetroVerse Portal
A simple "hub page" where users choose between Workbench Mode, Discovery Mode, or Raw Data Tools.
