# Application Shell Specification

## Overview
The RetroVerse application shell is a persistent top-level frame that provides a clear, nostalgic browsing experience rooted in simple exploration. The shell supports fast navigation between major content zones: the DJ Workbench, charts, nostalgia timelines, games, and event archives. It uses the RetroVerse dark theme with gold highlights and DM Serif Display headings for a warm, archival aesthetic.

## Navigation Structure
- Workbench → Tools and utilities for managing the Video Library and DJ workflows
- Discovery → Exploration of nostalgia content, spotlight stories, year jumpers
- Charts → Billboard Hot 100, AT40, MTV-era lists, chart runs, and analytics
- Games → Trivia, Pictionary, Retro challenges
- Events → Woodstock, Live Aid, TV shows, films, and cultural moments tied to music

## Layout Pattern
A single **top navigation bar** that remains visible across all pages.  
Page content scrolls beneath it.  
Sections load as independent screens, each with its own internal components.  
Spacing follows generous margins and padding to evoke a museum-like "exhibit" feel.  
Cards and lists follow the Video Library design tokens for consistency.
